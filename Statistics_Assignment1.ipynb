        "The probability density function (PDF) is a function used in statistics to describe the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value. Unlike discrete random variables, which use probability mass functions, continuous random variables use PDFs because they can take on an infinite number of values.\n",

        "- **Binomial Distribution**: Represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
        "- **Poisson Distribution**: Models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.\n",
        "- **Geometric Distribution**: Models the number of trials needed for the first success in repeated Bernoulli trials.\n",
        "- **Negative Binomial Distribution**: Generalizes the geometric distribution to count the number of trials needed to achieve a fixed number of successes.\n",
        "- **Hypergeometric Distribution**: Models the number of successes in a sample drawn without replacement from a finite population.\n",

        "These distributions apply to scenarios where the outcomes can take on any value within a continuous range.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Normal Distribution**: A symmetric distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve, defined by its mean and standard deviation.\n",
        "- **Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes are equally likely within a specified range.\n",
        "- **Exponential Distribution**: Models the time between events in a Poisson process; often used for modeling waiting times.\n",
        "- **Gamma Distribution**: Generalizes the exponential distribution; useful in various fields like queuing and reliability analysis.\n",
        "- **Beta Distribution**: Defined on the interval [0, 1]; often used in Bayesian statistics and modeling proportions.\n",
        "- **Log-Normal Distribution**: Models variables whose logarithm is normally distributed; common in financial contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Other Types\n",
        "- **Multivariate Distributions**: Distributions that involve multiple random variables (e.g., multivariate normal distribution).\n",
